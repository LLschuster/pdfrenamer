# PDF renamer

## description

This is a small aplication that is able to take a folder with pdfs inside, transform them into text,
run a specific business logic to find out what the pdf is about and generate a new name base on it.

This project showcases skills like handling files, running command utilities, using concurrency with waitGroup
and string handling.
